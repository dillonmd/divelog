Open source divelog made with React <br>
As of now you can add dives with Date, Location, Duration and Depth but they are stored with localStorage so beware of clearing your cache as you will lose your logs. <br>

## To-Do

- [X] Add Firebase Authentication 
- [ ] Style Navigation and Sign In/Sign Up Pages
- [ ] Replace ReactSimpleStorage with Firebase Database to save Logs properly
